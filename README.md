# fusion #

A connection oriented messaging framework built around the QPID Proton
engine.

This framework is meant to ease the integration of AMQP 1.0-based
messaging into existing applications.  It provides a very basic,
connection-oriented messaging model that should meet the needs of most
applications.

See the User Guide in the docs directory for more detail.
